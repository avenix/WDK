# Wearables Development Toolkit (WDK)

The Wearables Development Toolkit (WDK) is a framework and set of tools to facilitate the iterative development of activity recognition applications with wearable and IoT devices. It supports the annotation of time series data, the analysis and visualization of data to identify patterns and the development and performance assessment of activity recognition algorithms. At the core of the WDK is a repository of high-level components that encapsulate functionality used across activity recognition applications. These components can be used within a Matlab script or within a visual flo-based programming platform (i.e. Node-RED).

To get a first insight into the WDK, watch this [demo video:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow0b0vkciDs&t=1s)

## Setup

* ```git clone https://github.com/avenix/WDK.git```
* install Matlab 2019a or greater. 
* in Matlab, open the repository and type:  `addpath(genpath('./'))` in the console
* use the Apps in each directory (e.g. *AnnotationApp* in *1-Annotation/*).
* install the [Signal Processing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/signal.html) by clicking on the *Get More Apps* button on Matlab's toolbar.
* to avoid issues with pathing, Matlab's current path should be set to the root of the WDK directory: 

![Checking Matlab Path](doc/images/matlabPath.png)

* the '*./data*' directory should contain the following files and directories defined in the *Constants.m* file:

```
kLabelsPath = './data/annotations/labels.txt';
kAnnotationsPath = './data/annotations';
kMarkersPath = './data/markers';
kDataPath = './data/rawdata';
kCachePath = './data/cache';
kLabelGroupingsPath = './data/labeling';
kARChainsPath = './data/ARChains';
kVideosPath = './data/videos';
```
## 0- Data Conversion

The *Data Conversion App* can be used to convert your *.txt* data file to the format needed by the rest of the toolkit. The tool can load comma-separated files that look like:  
```
ax,ay,az,gx,gy,gz
-0.01940918,-0.05337523,-0.00286865,-0.2326506,0.5926659,0.10809
-0.01986694,-0.05346679,-0.003265379,0.002755165,-0.01103783
...
```
You can save a loaded file in the WDK's format by clicking on *Save Data WDK*. 

*Note: by default, the Data Conversion App loads data files from the ./data/rawdata/ directory. Converted files are saved to the ./ root directory. You should copy your converted files to the ./data/rawdata/  directory for the other tools to be able to use them.*

## 1- Data Annotation

An annotated data set is needed to train a machine learning algorithm and to assess its performance. The *Data Annotation App* offers functionality to annotate time series data. Depending on the particular application, one might want to annotate *events* that occurr at a specific moment in time or activities that have a duration in time, called *ranges*. The following image shows the squared magnitude of the accelerometer signal collected by a motion sensor attached at a hind leg of a cow. The individual strides of the cow have been annotated as event annotations (red) and the walking and running activities as ranges (black rectangles).

![Data Annotation App](doc/images/1-DataAnnotationApp.png)

### Annotating with video (optional)

The *Data Annotation App* can load and display videos next to the data. The video is synchronised to the data by matching two data samples to two video frames as defined in a synchronisation file. The format of a synchronisation file is:

```
sample1: 49727
sample2: 450209
frame1: 3302
frame2: 45284
```

The exact frames of a specific event in a video are displayed on the Movie Player at the bottom right of the window:

![Movie Player](doc/images/1-VideoPlayer.png)

In this application, we asked the subject to applaud three times in front of the camera while wearing an armband with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). We visualized the peak energy (i.e. squared magnitude) of the accelerometer signal and annotated each applause with the *synchronisation* label. When a data samples is selected on the plot, its timestamp is printed on Matlab's console. We copy the first synchronisation timestamp to the sample1 field of the synchronisation file. We do the same for the sample with timestamp *450209*. The respective annotated synchronisation events are shown in the following image:

![Event Annotations](doc/images/1-synchronisation.png)

Please note:

1. The *Data Annotation App* synchronises video and data at two points and interpolates linearly inbetween. We recommend the synchronisation points to take place in the beginning and end of a recording.
2. Annotation, marker, synchronisation and video files should be consistent with the data files. If a data file is named 'S1.mat', its annotation file should be named '*S1-annotations.txt*', its marker file '*S1-markers.edl*', its synchronisation file '*S1-synchronisation.txt*' and the video '*S1-video.videoFormat*'.
3. By default, the *Data Annotation App* loads annotation files from the '*./data/annotations/*', video and synchronisation files from '*./data/videos*' directory. Saved annotation files are located in the root '*./*' directory.
4. The labels to annotate should be defined in the '*labels.txt*' file beforehand.
5. You can use the keyboard shortcuts arrow-right, arrow-left and spacebar to iterate through data and video.

### Importing external markers (optional)
The *Data Annotation App* can import and display reference markers on top of the time series data. Currently, the *Data Annotation App* supports marker files created with the video annotation tool [DaVinciResolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/) in *.edl* format. Markers added to a timeline in DaVinciResolve can be exported by: right-clicking on the *Timeline -> timelines -> export -> Timeline markers to .EDL...*:

In order to synchronise video markers and time series data, the *.edl* file should contain a synchronisation marker in the beginning and another one in the end of the file. Currently, the first and last green marker are matched to the first and last event annotation with the label *synchronisaton*. In order to annotate data:

1. Annotate the video using DaVinci Resolve. Use a green marker to annotate a special event, ideally in the beginning and end of the file. (e.g. the user shakes the sensor three times in front of the camera).
2. Export the markers to an *.edl* file.
3. Copy the *.edl* file to the *data/markers/* directory.
4. Open the *Data Annotation App* and add an event annotation of the class *synchronisation* to the timestamp that corresponds .
5. Reopen the *Data Annotation App*. This time the markers should be properly aligned with the data.
6. Annotate the time series data.

*Note: markers in .edl format are read from the './data/markers' directory*.

## 2- Data Analysis
The *Data Analysis App* displays segments of data grouped by class. This is useful to study the differences across classes (e.g. to design an event detection or feature extraction algorithm). Segments can be plotted either on top of each other or sequentially (i.e. after each other). In order to visualize data:

1. Select one or more input data files.
2. Select where the segments should come from. *Manual annotations* creates segments from the range annotations and loads event annotations to create segments using the *ManualSegmentationStrategy*. The *Automatic segmentation* uses a preprocessing, event detection and segmentation algorithms selected over the user interface to create segments.
3. (in Automatic segmentation mode) Select the signals to use, a preprocessing algorithm and (optionally) an event detection algorithm.
4. Select a segmentation strategy and (optionally) a grouping strategy. Click the *Create* button. At this point the segments are created. A grouping strategy maps annotated labels to classes, usually by grouping different labels into classes.
5. Select signals and classes to visualize and a plot style (i.e. overlapping or sequential).

## 3- Algorithm Implementation

Most wearable device applications execute a chain (i.e. sequence) of computations in order to detect specific patterns based on sensor signals. This chain of computations is called the Activity Recognition Chain and consists of the following *stages*:
![Activity Recognition Chain](doc/images/ARC.png)

Applications in the WDK can be developed visually over [WDK-RED](https://github.com/avenix/WDK-RED), via the user interface provided by the different WDK Apps, or directly via code. 

### Visual Programming

Activity recognition applications can be developed visually in Node-RED using the nodes available in the [WDK-RED platform](https://github.com/avenix/wearable-prototyping). The following image shows an activity recognition chain for detecting and classifying soccer goalkeeper training exercises using a wearable motion sensor attached to a glove worn by a goalkeeper:

![Activity Recognition Chain](doc/images/WDK-RED.png)

Activity Recognition Chains can be imported and executed in the WDK as follows:

- Export the Activity Recognition Chains as described [here](https://github.com/avenix/WDK-RED#exporting).
- Execute the *convertJSONToWDK.m* script.
- Use the *Execute from File* button in each App.


### Text-based Programming

Activity recognition applications can be developed directly in Matlab as long as the WDK is in Matlab's path. The *Computer* class is the superclass of every reusable component. Every *Computer* has the following properties and methods:

```Matlab
inputPort; %type of the input this computer takes
outputPort; %type of the output this computer produces
nextComputers; %array of computers this computer is connected to
output = compute(obj,input); %the method executed when this computer is visited (implemented in each subclass) 
```

The following text snippet creates a chain of computations and saves it to the *goalkeeperChain.mat* file. This chain of computations detects events using a peak detector on the squared magnitude (sometimes called *energy*) of the accelerometer signal, segments the data around the detected events (200 samples to the left of the event and 30 sampels to the right) and extracts the features defined in the *goalkeeperFeatureChain.mat* file.

```Matlab
axisSelector = AxisSelector(1:3);%AX AY AZ
magnitudeSquared = MagnitudeSquared();

simplePeakDetector = SimplePeakDetector();
simplePeakDetector.minPeakHeight = single(0.8);
simplePeakDetector.minPeakDistance  = int32(100);

eventSegmentation = EventSegmentation();
eventSegmentation.segmentSizeLeft = 200;
eventSegmentation.segmentSizeRight = 30;

labeler = EventSegmentsLabeler();

featureExtractor = DataLoader.LoadComputer('goalkeeperFeatureChain.mat');

arcChain = Computer.ComputerWithSequence({FileLoader(),PropertyGetter('data'),...
axisSelector,magnitudeSquared,simplePeakDetector,eventSegmentation,labeler,...
featureExtractor});

DataLoader.SaveComputer(arcChain,'goalkeeperChain.mat');
```
This chain of computations produces a feature table that can be used within the *Assessment App* to study the performance of different machine learning algorithms.

## 4- Algorithm Assessment

The development and assessement / evaluation of an activity recognition algorithm usually represents a large fraction of the effort to develop the entire application. The *Assessment App* enables developers to design algorithms by selecting reusable components at each stage of the activity recognition chain and to assess their performance. The recognition performance metrics provided by this tool are:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- Confusion Matrix

and the computational performance metrics are:

- Flops: Number of floating point operations performed by the algorithm for the input data set
- Memory: Amount of memory consumed by the algorithm (in bytes) for the input data set
- Communication: Amount of bytes generated by the last component in the recognition chain 

The image below shows the configuration and classification results of an algorithm to detect and classify exercises performed by patients after a hip replacement surgery.

![Assessment App](doc/images/4-AssessmentApp.png)

The *Performance Asessment Detail View* displays the classification results on top of the data and next to the corresponding video. Green overlays indicate correctly classified segments and red overlays indicate misclassified segments.

![Assessment App Detail View](doc/images/4-AssessmentAppDetail.png)

### Event Detection
Some wearable applications need to detect the occurrence of specific events in a stream of sensor values. The challenge is to detect the relevant events (also called target-class or true positives) while ignoring irrelevant events (also called non-target class or false positives). 

The *Event Detection App* can be used to compare the performance of different event detection algorithms. This includes the amount of relevant and irrelevant events detected for each recording session / file and the amount of events detected of each class.

![Event Detection App](doc/images/3-EventDetectionApp.png)

The *Event Detection Detail View* enables developers to gain insight into the performance of a particular event detection algorithm. Developers can zoom into the data and observe the detected and missed events together with the video. 

![Event Detection App Detail View](doc/images/3-EventDetectionAppDetail.png)

*Note: Feature tables generated with a particular activity recognition algorithm can be exported to *.txt* formats to study the classification on other platforms such as python / tensorFlow and WEKA.*

The amount of memory and output size of the *PropertyGetter* and *NoOp* modules depend on their input and configuraton values and are computed at runtime.

 
 ## Getting started
1. The WDK loads data from a binary .mat file containing an instance of the *DataFile* class found in *./ARC/model* directory. The *Data Conversion App* can load any file in CSV format and export it to the *DataFile* format. Place your CSV files in the *./data/rawdata/* directory.
2. The labels used by the WDK should be listed in the *.data/annotations/labels.txt* file.
3. Use the *Data Annotation App* to create a ground truth data set.
4. (optional) Define a label grouping. A label grouping describes how labels annotated are mapped to groups used by the different Apps in the WDK. The following label grouping maps labels *label1*, *label2* and *label3* into *Group1* and *label4* and *label5* to *Group2*.
```
#Group1 
class1
class2
class3

#Group2
class4
class5
```
If no label grouping is defined, the WDK uses the *defaultLabelingStrategy* which maps each label to a class with the same name.

*Note: Labels grouped in a label grouping should be defined in the './data/annotations/labels.txt' file*.

*Note: Label groupings should be placed in the './data/labeling/' directory*.

*Note: Labels should be mapped to a single group in a labeling strategy. Labels that are left ungrouped in a labeling strategy will be assigned to its own group automatically*.
 
 ## Troubleshooting

Most errors after installation are related to pathing issues. The paths used by the WDK are defined in the *Constants.m* file. Double-check the different paths in the *Constants.m* file exist in your file system.

Furthermore, errors identified by Matlab will be shown over the console:

> 'Error. Invalid annotation class'. 

An annotation file in *./data/annotations/* contains an invalid label (i.e. a label which is not listed in the *./data/annotations/labels.txt* file).


> 'Index in position 1 exceeds array bounds (must not exceed XXX).'

 > 'Warning - FeatureSelector - every segment has same value. Feature selection might fail';
 
 The current version of the *FeatureSelector* uses the mRMR algorithm to select the most relevant features. The mRMR algorithm will fail if every feature vector contains the same value for a particular feature.

The WDK has been developed based on Matlab's version 2018b. If Matlab crashes with these errors:

 > 'Too many input arguments'
  
 > 'Unrecognized property 'Scrollable' for class 'matlab.ui.Figure'
 
double-check that your are using Matlab 2018b or later. 

*Note: The data in the './data/rawData' directory should be consistent. You will get errors if different files have different amount of columns.* 

*Note: Double-check that the './data/annotations/' directory contains an annotation file for each data file in './data/rawdata/'.* 

*Note: A common error happens due to selecting incompatible computer nodes. As the WDK does not do type-checking on the computers selected, the first computer that received incompatible data will crash. If Matlab produces an error message with 'Computer.ExecuteChain' in its stack-trace, it is most likely due to an incompatible set of computers being used. In this case, double-check the input and output types of each computer.*

* the feature selection feature in the WDK uses the mRMR library for feature selection. If you get an error '*estpab function not found*', then you need to:
```
cd libraries/mRMR_0.9/mi/
mex -setup C++ 
makeosmex
```
