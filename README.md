# Wearables Development Toolkit (WDK)

The Wearables Development Toolkit (WDK) is a set of tools to facilitate the development of wearable device / activity recognition applications. The usual activities involved in the development of such applications are: data collection, data annotation, algorithm development, algorithm evaluation and deployment (i.e. integration of the code into the wearable device): 

![Activity Recognition Chain Development](doc/images/ARCDevelopment.png)

## Setup

* install Matlab 2018b or greater. 
* `git clone git@github.com:avenix/ARC-Tutorial.git`
* in Matlab, `addpath(genpath('./'))`
* use the Apps in each directory (e.g. *Data Annotation App* in *1-DataAnnotation/*).
* this code uses the mRMR library for feature selection. If you get an error 'estpab function not found', then you need to:
```
cd libraries/mRMR_0.9/mi/
mex -setup C++ 
makeosmex
```

The WDK requires the installation of the Signal Processing Toolbox:

![Signal Processing Toolbox](doc/images/DSP.png)

*Note: to avoid issues with pathing, Matlab's current path should be set to the root of the WDK directory:* 

![Checking Matlab Path](doc/images/matlabPath.png)

### Data Structure

The '*/data*' directory should contain the following files and directories defined in the *Constants.m* file:

```
classesPath = './data/classes.txt';
annotationsPath = './data/annotations';
markersPath = './data/markers';
dataPath = './data/rawdata';
precomputedPath = './data/cache';
labelingStrategiesPath = './data/labeling';
kVideosPath = './data/videos';
```
## Data Collection

The *Data Loader App* can be used to do a first check on the data after its collection. It offers the following features:
- Load any tabularized ".txt" data file and save it to Matlab's binary format, which is used by the rest of the toolkit.
- Check whether there has been data loss. For this purpose, a timestamp / counter signal and an sampling interval should be provided.
- Visualize the different signals.

![DataLoaderApp](doc/images/0-DataLoaderApp.png)

*Note: by default, the DataLoaderApp loads data files from the ./data/rawdata/ directory. Files are saved to the ./ root directory.*

## Data Annotation

An annotated data set is needed to train a machine learning algorithm and to assess its performance. The *Data Annotation App* offers functionality to annotate time series data. Depending on the particular application, one might want to annotate specific events or activities that have a duration in time. The *Data Annotation App* supports both kinds of annotations.

![Data Annotation App](doc/images/1-DataAnnotationApp.png)

### Annotating with Video (optional)

The *Data Annotation App* can load and display videos next to the data. The video is synchronised to the data by matching two data samples to two video frames as defined in a synchronisation file. The format of a synchronisation file is:

```
sample1: 49727
sample2: 450209
frame1: 3302
frame2: 45284
```

The exact frames of a specific event in a video can be found by iterating the video frame by frame. The current video frame is shown at the bottom right of the window:

![Video Player App](doc/images/1-VideoPlayer.png)

In this application, we asked the subject to applaud three times in front of the camera while wearing an armband with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). We visualized the peak energy (i.e. squared magnitude) of the accelerometer signal and annotated each applause with the *synchronisation* label. When a data samples is selected on the plot, its timestamp is printed on Matlab's console. We copy the first synchronisation timestamp to the sample1 field of the synchronisation file. We do the same for the sample with timestamp *450209*. The respective annotated synchronisation events are shown in the following image:

![Event Annotations](doc/images/1-synchronisation.png)

*Note: the AnnotationApp synchronises video and data at two points and interpolates linearly inbetween. We recommend the synchronisation points to take place in the beginning and end of a recording session.*

*Tipp: use the keyboard shortcuts arrow-right, arrow-left and spacebar to iterate through the data and video.*

To consider:

1. Annotation, marker, synchronisation and video files should be consistent with the data files. If a data file is named 'S1.mat', its annotation file should be named 'S1-annotations.txt', its marker file 'S1-markers.edl', its synchronisation file 'S1-synchronisation.txt' and the video 'S1-video.extension'.
2. By default, the *Data Annotation App* loads annotation files from the './data/annotations/', video and synchronisation files from './data/videos' directory. Saved annotation files are located in the root './' directory.
3. The classes to annotate should be defined in the 'classes.txt' file beforehand.

### Annotating with External Markers (optional)
The *Data Annotation App* can import and display reference markers on top of the time series data. Currently, the *Data Annotation App* supports marker files created with the video annotation tool [DaVinciResolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/) in *.edl* format. Markers added to a timeline in DaVinciResolve can be exported by: right-clicking on the *Timeline -> timelines -> export -> Timeline markers to .EDL...*:

![DaVinciResolve](doc/images/1-markers.png)

Before the markers can be displayed properly on top of the time series data, they need to be synchronised to the time series data. In order to do this, the *.edl* file should contain a synchronisation marker in the beginning and another one in the end of the file. Currently, the first and last green marker are matched to the first and last event annotation of the class *synchronisaton*. In order to annotate data:

1. Annotate the video using DaVinci Resolve. Use a green marker to annotate a special event, ideally in the beginning and end of the file. (e.g. the user shakes the sensor three times in front of the camera).
2. Export the markers to an *.edl* file.
3. Copy the *.edl* file to the *data/markers/* directory.
4. Open the *Data Annotation App* and add an event annotation of the class *synchronisation* to the timestamp that corresponds .
5. Reopen the *Data Annotation App*. This time the markers should be properly aligned with the data.
6. Annotate the time series data.

*Note: markers in .edl format are read from the './data/markers' directory*.

## Data Visualization
The *Data Visualization App* displays segments of data grouped by class. This is useful to study the differences across classes (e.g. to design an event detection or feature extraction algorithm). Segments can be plotted either on top of each other or sequentially (i.e. after each other). In order to visualize data:

1. Select one or more input data files.
2. Select where the segments should come from. *Manual annotations* creates segments from the range annotations and loads event annotations to create segments using the *ManualSegmentationStrategy*. The *Automatic segmentation* uses a preprocessing, event detection and segmentation algorithms selected over the user interface to create segments.
3. (in Automatic segmentation mode) Select the signals to use, a preprocessing algorithm and (optionally) an event detection algorithm.
4. Select a segmentation strategy and (optionally) a grouping strategy. Click the *Create* button. At this point the segments are created.
6. Select signals and classes to visualize and a plot style.

## Event Detection
Some wearable applications need to detect the occurrence of specific events in a stream of sensor values. The challenge is to detect the relevant events (also called target-class or true positives) while ignoring irrelevant events (also called non-target class or false positives). 

The *Event Detection App* can be used to compare the performance of different event detection algorithms. This includes the amount of relevant and irrelevant events detected for each file / subject and the amount of events detected of each class. The *Event Detection App* enables developers to gain insight into the performance of a particular event detection algorithm. For this purpose, a developer might zoom into the data and observe the detected and missed events together with the data. 

![Data Annotation App](doc/images/3-EventDetectionApp.png)

## Application Development

Most wearable device applications execute a chain (i.e. sequence) of computations in order to detect specific patterns based on sensor signals. This chain of computations is called the Activity Recognition Chain and consists of the following *stages*:

The WDK provides the following reusable components:

 ## Evaluation
 
 The iterative development and evaluation of an activity recognition algorithm usually takes a large fraction of the development effort. The *Data Evaluation App* enables developers to design an algorithm by selecting reusable components at each stage of the activity recognition chain and assess its performance. The calculated performance metrics are:
 
 Recognition Performance:
 - Accuracy
 - Precision
 - Recall
 - Confusion Matrix
 
 Computational Performance:
 - Flops: Number of floating point operations performed by the algorithm for the input data set
 - Memory: Amount of memory consumed by the algorithm (in bytes) for the input data set
 - Communication: Amount of bytes output by the last component in the recognition chain (requires the user to map the computation components to hardware devices) 
 
 ![Data Annotation App](doc/images/4-EvaluationApp.png)
 
 *Note: The generated feature tables can be exported to *.mat* and *.txt* formats. The *.txt* format makes it possible to study the classification on other platforms such as python / tensorFlow and WEKA.*
 

 ## Getting started
1. The WDK loads data from a binary .mat file containing an instance of the *DataFile* class found in *./ARC/model* directory. The *DataConversionApp* can load any file in CSV format and export it to the *DataFile* format. Place your CSV files in the *./data/rawdata/* directory.
2. The classes used by the WDK should be listed in the *classes.txt* file.
3. Use the *AnnotationApp* to create a ground truth data set.
4. (optional) Define a labeling strategy. While annotating the data, a developer might not know exactly what the application should detect / classify. In this case, it might be convenient to annotate the data at a greater level of detail than the application will need. A labeling strategy describes how classes are mapped to the groups used by a machine learning classifier. The following labeling strategy maps classes *class1*, *class2* and *class3* into *Group1* and *class4* and *class5* to group *Group2*.
```
#Group1 
class1
class2
class3

#Group2
class4
class5
```

*Note: Classes mentioned in a labeling strategy should be defined in the './data/classes.txt' file*.
*Note: Labeling strategies should be placed in the './data/labeling/' directory*.
*Note: Classes should be mapped to a single group in a labeling strategy. Classes that are left ungrouped in a labeling strategy will be assigned to its own group automatically*.
 
 ## Troubleshooting

Most errors after installation are related to pathing issues. The paths used by the WDK are defined in the *Constants.m* file. Double-check the different paths in the *Constants.m* file exist in your file system.

Furthermore, errors identified by Matlab will be shown over the console:

> 'Error. Invalid annotation class'. 

An annotation file in *./data/annotations/* contains an invalid label (i.e. a class which is not listed in the *./data/classes.txt* file)  


> 'Index in position 1 exceeds array bounds (must not exceed XXX).'

> 'Error. class not defined'
 
 The *ClassesMap* triggers this error when it is requested to map a string of an invalid class. This error might be due to a file in the  *./data/labeling/* directory containing an invalid class name.
 
 > 'Warning - FeatureSelector - every segment has same value. Feature selection might fail';
 
 The current version of the *FeatureSelector* uses the mRMR algorithm to select the most relevant features. The mRMR algorithm will fail if every feature vector contains the same value for a particular feature.

The WDK has been developed based on Matlab's version 2018b. If Matlab crashes with these errors:

 > 'Too many input arguments'
  
 > 'Unrecognized property 'Scrollable' for class 'matlab.ui.Figure'
 
double-check that your are using Matlab 2018b or later. 

*Note: The data in the './data/rawData' directory should be consistent. You will get errors if different files have different amount of columns.* 

*Note: Double-check that the './data/annotations/' directory contains an annotation file for each data file in './data/rawdata/'.* 

*Note: A common error happens due to selecting incompatible computer nodes. As the WDK does not do type-checking on the computers selected, the first computer that received incompatible data will crash. If Matlab produces an error message with 'Computer.ExecuteChain' in its stack-trace, it is most likely due to an incompatible set of computers being used. In this case, double-check the input and output types of each computer.*
