************************ Change log *****************************

2005-10-23: Fix a programming bug in estmutualinfo.cpp which might lead to segmentation fault is not input the p1 and p2 parameters. In fact this has not led to any 
dfference in the mutualinfo.m program, as I always call estmutualinfo using three parameters. BTW, I detected this bug when I wrote the C++ version of mRMR selection 
program.
